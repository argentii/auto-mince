# auto-mince
Make mincemeat of monotonous Minecraft. Manage manual mining, menial maintenance, etc. 
Scripts for task automation in Minecraft, intended to be used on personal worlds/servers.

The current iteration of this code uses pyautogui, which does not work as intended on operating systems using Wayland as their windows manager, a.k.a. a ton of modern Linux distros. However, the autoclicker has been tested on Windows and works as intended. A second version of the autoclicker which will be functional on both Linux/Windows is in the works.

Planned (high-to-low priority):
-add Wayland-compatible autoclicker
-develop autofisher
